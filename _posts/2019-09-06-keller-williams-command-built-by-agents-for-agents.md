The way an agent markets themselves is essential to their business, but properly developing and executing one’s marketing strategy isn’t always so simple. This is where Keller Williams Command comes in.

**Keller Williams Command is an end-to-end marketing platform built by and for real estate agents.** This one-of-a-kind tool utilizes everything agents have been asking for.

One of this platform’s features is Sketchhouse Designs: our marketing warehouse, which allows agents to view, customize, and save designs that can be used on social media, email campaigns, text campaigns, on your website, or ordered for print. This is hugely beneficial, as using consistent designs throughout these various mediums will boost the productivity of your marketing.&nbsp;

Not only does Sketchhouse Designs give you access to all of your marketing designs with just a few clicks, but it also grants you the ability to take advantage of another tool—lead accelerator, which lets you boost designs on social media. Better still, you can do so without paying a middle party. This will give you more clicks and leads for your dollar than on Facebook or Google ads, thanks to the fact that you’re working straight from one convenient source.&nbsp;

And since the entire Keller Williams Command platform works off of AI, it constantly learns from user input. Over time, the platform records trends on what techniques, marketing mediums, and designs perform the best, and will show you rankings for all of the marketing elements you employ. In short, this platform gives you the tools to reach your database, while also guiding you on the most effective ways to do so.&nbsp;
