The markets all over California are undergoing a shift, including here in San Diego and North County.

In Gary Keller's book “The Shift: How Top Agents Tackle Tough Times,” Gary teaches us that there are three types of real estate agents that tend to show up when the market shifts:

**1. The pessimist.** This is the agent who thinks that their career is changing, their business is changing, and that real estate is too hard—market shifts cause these agents to rethink their careers altogether.

**2. The optimist.** The optimistic agent is in denial about what’s happening in the market with regards to prices, interest rates, days on market, and so on. They think that the market will suddenly return to how it was a year ago. The optimist isn’t paying attention to the actual numbers, stats, and data—they’re ostriches with their heads in the sand.

**3. The realist.** The realist plans for a market shift, but also studies and implements models, systems, and tools that are proven by top agents.

Clearly, I recommend approaching the shifting market with a realist’s attitude.

Here’s an interesting statistic: The last time we had a shift in the market about 10 years ago, Keller Williams was the No. 4 real estate company in the nation. We emerged from that shift as the No. 1 company. That means those realist agents, who studied proven models and systems, were attracted to our business and succeeded by joining us.

That period was a lot like today—the market is shifting again. With that in mind, I want to invite you to come pick up a free copy of “The Shift.” I’d be happy to share it with you, and when you’ve read it, we can talk about it further, if you’d like. There are actually 12 tactics to engage in the shift and see it less as a scary market change and more as what we call “the gift of the shift.”<br><br>If you would like a free copy of “The Shift” or you have any other questions, feel free to reach out and contact me. I look forward to speaking with you.
