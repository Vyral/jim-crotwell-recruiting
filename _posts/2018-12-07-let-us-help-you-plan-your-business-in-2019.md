As we come to the end of the year, real estate agents all over the area will be getting their business plans in place for 2019. People tend to put a lot of energy into building these plans, but then they put them away and don’t look at them again until the end of the year.

**We do things a little bit differently here at Keller Williams with our GPS plan.** It’s a living business plan. I’ve taught this plan in plenty of places all over Southern California and I’m doing it again in Carlsbad on December 18.

It’s called “Reset and Recharge” and it’s the perfect time to plan your business for 2019, especially in this shifting market.

**We’ll cover many different topics in the meeting, including the 7 myth understandings of real estate.** One of them is the idea that “This won’t work in my market” for whatever reason. Another is “I can’t accomplish that because I don’t have enough time.” Debunking these myths will really help get your mind in the right place. That is so important because I firmly believe that your mindset is 80% of your success in your business.

This is just a short preview of what you’ll learn in the “Reset and Recharge” event. **The last time we did this, the agents on our team saw huge success.** Within 45 days, we had three active listings and four buyer escrows from those agents that directly correlated with their GPS business plan.

If you have any questions about the event in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I hope to see you there!
