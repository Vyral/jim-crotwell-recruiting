In the last episode of our technology series, we discussed what a “platform” is. If you missed that episode, you can find it [here](https://kwcareerquest.com/what-separates-a-tech-platform-from-bolt-on-technology.html){: target="_blank"}. &nbsp;

This time, we’re going to continue our series by talking about the different ways to track your technology-related expenses as an agent.&nbsp;

The amount of money a given agent invests into technology will depend on the way they run their business, as well as how long they’ve been in the industry. **Veteran agents, for example, spend an average of $10,000 on technology.** This includes video marketing, email campaigns, and many other digital resources.&nbsp;

However much you’re spending on technology right now, you need to be aware of the dollar amount at all times. To do this, write down all the technology-related expenses you can think of in your business, then have your admin staff double check that list. After that, review your credit card statement and see exactly what you’re paying.&nbsp;

Once you know how much you’re spending, you can then assess whether all of the things you’re investing in are worth it. Every cent you spend should bring you a return in one way or another.&nbsp;

In the near future, though, you’ll be able to eliminate many of these expenses altogether, as **Keller Williams’ is currently rolling out a new end-to-end technology platform that is free to all KW agents.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions about the KW technology platform or about anything else, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
