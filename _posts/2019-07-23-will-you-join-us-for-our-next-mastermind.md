Today I’d like to just take a moment to tell you about some great panels and other events that we’ve got coming up.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

**One is our Top Producer Mastermind, where we invite three or four of our top agents and one outside agent to discuss a monthly topic.** These have been really powerful over the last few months.&nbsp;

The first one we did was about client events and what people are doing in that arena. A few top producers shared what they did, ranging from expensive dinner parties to cheaper events that can still make an impact in the community.&nbsp;

The second mastermind covered the topic: “How to become the local expert in your farm.” This discussion revolved around market data, knowing your market stats, and more. This time, we had two top producers demonstrate what they’re doing.&nbsp;

**We’ll probably repeat those two topics going forward, but I also want to know what topics you’d like us to discuss.** Also, what expert agents do you know that would like to be on a future panel? If you have any suggestions, we’d love for you to reach out to us today and let us know.

One of the most important things to us at KW is collaboration. **We are happy to collaborate with great agents and would love to collaborate with you in the future.** If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
