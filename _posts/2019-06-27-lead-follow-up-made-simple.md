Many agents invest adequate time, energy, and resources into lead generation, but fewer take the necessary steps when it comes to lead follow-up. And given how stressful it can be to reach out to leads you’ve already contacted, it’s no wonder why. On top of that, companies like Redfin and Zillow have apps that will automatically follow up with leads, making the playing field even more difficult for agents.&nbsp;

Thankfully, **Keller Williams will soon be launching a consumer app that has been tested and proven to be preferred above other competing applications.&nbsp;**

In short, not only does Keller Williams provide its agents with a technology-based real estate platform, but it will also soon give them access to a consumer-facing app that makes daunting tasks like lead follow-up much easier. &nbsp;

When your clients have this app on their phone, you will be instantly positioned as their local expert for all things real estate. T**his way, you’ll be at the front of their mind from the moment they’re ready to buy or sell.**
