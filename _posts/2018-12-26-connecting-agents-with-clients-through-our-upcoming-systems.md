We’ve all felt the impact that technology has made on our lives, and the real estate world is no different. Going into 2019, however, technology is impacting the industry in a way it never has before—**in a way that could actually be causing you to lose business.**

What we’re going to see going forward are two types of agents: agents who use technology, and technology that uses agents. We at Keller Williams see technology as a valuable resource to use, but not one that should control our professionals altogether.

**There are three things we’ll be rolling out in early 2019:**

* **KW.com and mobile search app.** These will help connect the consumer with properties and agents.
* **KW Command.** This connects the consumer to the agent.
* **KW Connect.** This connects the agent to their market center or brokerage.

**All three of these are integrated into one system** that will help agents work and run their business—from the original home search all the way to closing a transaction.

If you’re not with Keller Williams and want to know what this upcoming technology can do for your business, **keep an eye on your email over the next few months.** We’ll be sharing with you monthly masterminds with top agents who have implemented these tools in their businesses.

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to helping you.
