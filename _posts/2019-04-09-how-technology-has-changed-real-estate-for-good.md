Technology has shaped our modern world, and the real estate industry is no exception. Today I’d like to delve into three key ways real estate is changing as a result:

1. **The MLS is no longer a secret.** Gone are the days when only real estate professionals had access to the multiple listing service. Today, everyone can see what’s available. Not only that, but with the internet at their fingertips, buyers can easily educate themselves on the real estate process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
2. **People are doing business on their phones.** Though it may not be what you’re used to, it’s important to learn to embrace this technology. If I asked 100 real estate agents if they use an app to reach their clients, they may say yes. But if I were to take it a step further and ask those same agents if all of their clients actually use that app as their preferred real estate resource, their answers might not be so consistent. If you can crack the code on making your mobile presence as strong as possible, your business will be more likely to endure into the future.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
3. **Technology is taking business away from agents.** You can probably remember at least a few times when a potential client turned down your services in favor of using some online resource instead. This can feel like a punch to the gut, but especially when you realize that these lost clients only constitute a portion of the opportunities you’re missing out on. You need to work with, not against, technology if you want to keep drawing in leads.&nbsp;
