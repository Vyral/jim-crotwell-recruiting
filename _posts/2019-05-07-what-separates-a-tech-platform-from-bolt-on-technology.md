Welcome back to the latest installment in our technology series\!

Today we’ll expand on the **differences between “bolt-on” technology and a technology platform.** This is an important distinction to make for not only how you run your business, but for your expenses as well.&nbsp;

**It’s important for an agent to harness technology in such a way that it supports your business as opposed to taking your business.** In our last video, we covered the difference between a technology-enabled agent and an agent enabling technology. If you missed it,[ you can check it out here.&nbsp;](https://kwcareerquest.com/who-is-the-fiduciary.html){: target="_blank"}

Agents across the real estate industry proudly proclaim that their brokerage or company is tech-friendly and, because of this, technology is entirely at their disposal. Much of the technology they’re referring to is “bolt-on.” At 1:00 in the video, you can see the various forms that bolt-on technology takes.&nbsp;

An agent who uses technology in this way might have a CRM for their database, along with different mechanisms for their marketing, lead generation, neighborhood research, and maintaining transactions.&nbsp;

It’s no surprise that the problem with these technologies is that they tend to be disjointed, independent of one another, and non-communicative and going this route would require multiple databases. You also have to factor in the costs: One could cost $25, another might run $79, and yet another could be $200 per transaction. This can add up quickly for various technologies that don’t communicate.&nbsp;

**Later this year, Keller Williams will be unveiling their all-new, all-in-one technology platform as an alternative to this.** This leading-edge, singular platform will give agents the ability to do everything from lead generation to database management to client maintenance and all things in between. Such a tool will change how we do real estate going forward.&nbsp;
