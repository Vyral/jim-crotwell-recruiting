By playing ‘red light, green light,’ I’m referring to managing expenses, which is one of the most important things you can do in a shifting market.

Here at Keller Williams, we have a formula and a tool to manage your expenses and re-margin your business by analyzing where you’re spending money. We teach our agents that for every single dollar you spend, you should expect a return on investment, and **if you’re not getting that return, either shift those expenses or stop them altogether**. This is what is known as playing ‘red light, green light.’

Based on the experiences of our producing agents locally and around the country, we know what areas need to be red and what areas need to be green. We share that information with our agents and coach them on those areas because we know that **you can’t build your business just by cutting expenses; you have to continue your lead generation**. You can, however, find your profit and protect it by playing ‘red light, green light.’ It’s a fantastic tool, but not enough agents are utilizing it like they should.
