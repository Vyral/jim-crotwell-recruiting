What is the new “Opportunities” app in KW Command and what can it do for you?

With Opportunities, **y****ou can navigate the first conversation you have with a client all the way to closing and getting paid all on one screen.** Also, it calculates pending commission, possible commission, and actual commission based on your true work percentages for your conversion rates from beginning to closing, and it reminds you of follow-ups and tasks and keeps compliance and pay items in the same place.&nbsp;

The reason so many agents are excited about Opportunities is it enhances the motivation for follow-ups by letting you see the dollar amount attached. While watching the transaction step by step from beginning to end, you can see your money go from potential income to probable income to actual income.

On top of that, it tracks your business (how much of it is listings, how much of it is**&nbsp;**sales, how much of it is leases, etc.) and where that business comes from.&nbsp;
