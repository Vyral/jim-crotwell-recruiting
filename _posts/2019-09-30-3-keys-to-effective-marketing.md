Marketing campaigns can either be expensive or inexpensive, but regardless of cost, it’s very important that your marketing strategy follows a few simple rules:

**1\. Get a marketing department.** Here at Keller Williams, we actually have three marketing departments. All three are proprietary and only apply to KW agents. Having a marketing department will save you tons of time when it comes to preparing a marketing campaign, be it print, mail, social media, and so on. With a team of specialists, you won’t have to struggle with a particular piece of software to create a piece for your campaign.

<br>**2\. Make use of online tools.** All of the necessary materials for the previous point are available online as well as in-person when you work with KW, meaning you can work from home or when you’re out of town. You can save your designs so that every time you take a listing or you create a marketing update, your designs are available for use.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>**3\. Keep it consistent across different mediums.** For example, if your business card doesn’t match your market update, open house flyer, or even your Facebook banner, it will greatly diminish the impact your marketing will have on those who know you and those you want to know you. Additionally, pay attention to what other brokerages do—many times, you couldn’t tell one agent from another through the marketing materials provided, which ultimately doesn’t help agents. Combine consistency in your marketing and your look, but also try to distinguish yourself from the many other agents in your brokerage. You want your clients to reach out to you, not your brokerage.

All of these things can be accomplished here at Keller Williams. If you’d like a personal tour of all our marketing services, feel free to contact me at my office for an appointment. I’d be happy to walk you through them.<br>&nbsp;
