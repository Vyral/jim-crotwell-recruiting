Agent support is among the most important resources a real estate professional has to draw on in their career—and I’m not talking about the kind of limited support offered to most agents out there. Instead, **I’m talking about the sort of top-tier support that helps agents gain momentum in the industry.**

It doesn’t matter if an agent has been in the business for 10 days or 10 years—they still need support in order to get to the next level.

Allow me to introduce you to the Agent Leadership Council (ALC). Every Keller Williams market center, the Carlsbad location included, selects eight, nine, or 10 of its top agents each year to serve on the ALC. **These agents then get together once per month in order to help run their market center.**

Keller Williams market centers are intrinsically agent centric, given that they are literally run by their agents. There are three things about how ALC’s run their market centers that I believe to be the most impactful:

1. **The monthly masterminds.** Imagine what it would do for your business if you were able to learn directly from your market center’s top-producing agents.
2. **The Ignite Program.** This 12-session jumpstart program has played a major role in helping Keller Williams maintain its status as the No. 1 training company in the world.
3. **Our open-door policy.** Every agent within the Keller Williams Carlsbad market center has an open-door policy, meaning that they are always there to provide support, offer advice, and answer questions.

The bottom line is that Keller Williams offers a culture of collaboration. We are all in this together.
