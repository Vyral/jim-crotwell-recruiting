So we’re already a full month into the new year. How are your resolutions holding up? Today I’m talking to you about goal setting and how to ensure that 2020 is your best year yet.&nbsp;

Most people in the industry set a goal at the beginning of the year for how many transactions they want to complete, though very few actually write it down. What if I told you that you could net $1 million from your real estate commissions over 12 months by simply going on seven appointments per week?&nbsp;

It’s not magic, it’s just math. **Whatever your 2020 goal, we can accomplish it by working backward and figuring out the basic math involved.** Here is what we’ve termed ‘The Millionaire Combination,’ a breakdown of what would be needed on average to net $1 million in commission:&nbsp;

* 125 closings&nbsp;
* 63 listings sold
* 84 listings taken&nbsp;
* 112 listing appointments
* 10 appointments a month&nbsp;
* 3 appointments a week

**My goal this year is to help 20 of our agents crush the millionaire goal.** Are you one of the 20? I’m happy to sit down with you and talk about your goals to capitalize on our booming Carlsbad market.&nbsp;

Come into the office, or we can meet for coffee—either way, we can both accomplish our goals this year by getting on the same page. 2020 is going to be awesome\!&nbsp;

If you have any other real estate-related questions, feel free to reach out to me for those answers, too. I’m always happy to help.&nbsp;
