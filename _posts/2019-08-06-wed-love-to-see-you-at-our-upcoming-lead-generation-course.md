We’ve got a whole list of events coming up this September, and you won’t want to miss the one I’m unveiling today: **On Thursday, September 12, the one and only Gene Rivers will be teaching an all-day course on lead generation.&nbsp;**

If you’re not familiar with Gene and his story, let me fill you in. He has four offices in Florida and along the East Coast with over 500 Keller Williams agents working under him. For more than 20 years, he and his wife have had their own mega-production, top-producing team. He also owns an escrow company as well as an investment company. Now, he spends a lot of his time traveling across the country and teaching at various Keller Williams offices. &nbsp; &nbsp;

This event on September 12 is open to all agents in the area, and we expect a few hundred people to attend. **It’ll run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and will be held at The Westin Carlsbad, located at 5480 Grand Pacific Drive.&nbsp;**

Now, let me ask you a question: What was the last class you attended at your office? A contracts class? Perhaps it was a broker update. The reason I ask is that a lot of the material that offices and brokerages teach concerns the transactional side of the business. That’s all well and good, but in my view, there’s a lack of emphasis and education on the business generation side.&nbsp;

Basically, your business can be broken down into three categories: lead generation, lead follow-up, and transacting. They’re all equally important, but on September 12, **we’ll delve deeper into new ways and strategies to improve your lead generation.&nbsp;**

What we won’t do is overwhelm you with 50 different strategies and wish you luck in implementing all of them. We’ll do two things instead: First, w**e’ll underscore two or three strategies to work into your business,** which will help maximize your lead generation.&nbsp;

Secondly, **we’ll talk a lot about follow-up**—how to do it and when to do it. If you lack strong follow-up skills, I can guarantee you’re leaving money on the table and missing opportunities for business. &nbsp;

You’ll receive some information via email from me soon, but in the meantime, make a note of this event on your calendar and reach out to me with any questions you have. I hope to see you there\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
