Keller Williams Family Reunion is right around the corner and I am so excited for it. The problem with most real estate conventions, in general, is that the focus tends to drift away from lead generation and toward selling products or systems that don’t get to the heart of building a business.

**At KW Family Reunion, the event is completely organized around the top agents sharing their best practices.** I’ve gone every year for the last nine years and I’ll be in New Orleans for this year's conference.

There are going to be about 15,000 agents from across the country here, and they’ll be bringing some great energy and great information. The week is organized into “breakout sessions” and attendees have to pick and choose which presentations they’re going to attend. **It’s fun to go with a team because then you can be in two places at once and come together later to share what you’ve learned.**

In addition, Gary Keller is back as CEO and giving a keynote speech. All of the keynote speakers are going to be focused on talking about the technology that KW is coming out with. **I’m excited to attend, take notes, and learn more about how to build my business.**

If you haven’t signed up for KW Family Reunion yet, but you’re interested in going, it’s not too late. Reach out to me today and we can help you get out there. If you can’t make it, don’t worry—I’ll be happy to share what I’ve learned with you when I get back.

If you have any more questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
