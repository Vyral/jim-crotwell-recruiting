Searching for homes on mobile devices is all the rage nowadays, and it has become quite clear that if you’re not in front of your customers from the get-go, not just from when they want to look at houses, you’re going to lose business. So how do we as agents make sure that we’re in a position to stay connected with our clients at all times?

**This January, Keller Williams is rolling out an all-new consumer app** available on both mobile devices and desktop computers. This is like nothing they’ve ever seen before from a brokerage, and I’m super excited to help our agents get up and running with this new tech.

We fully expect this to be the preferred consumer experience; the app has been introduced to focus groups all over the country over the last six to nine months, and we’ve been developing it intensely these past two years.

I encourage you to pay attention to your email and to take me up on one of our mastermind meetings to really see what’s going on with this Keller Williams mobile search app. **It’s designed to help you, the real estate agent, to stay in charge of your business and deliver the No. 1 consumer experience to your customer.**

If you have any questions or would like more information about this app, feel free to reach out to me.
